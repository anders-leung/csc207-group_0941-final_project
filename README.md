# csc207-group_0941-final_project

This final project for my CSC207 Software Design class ended up having a very messy and confusing structure.  We were supposed save the final revision into a different folder, but I guess that did not work out.  There are other README files within this repository, but ultimately, we disgned and implemented an app that was supposed to help hospitals perform triage on their patients.  The users were separated into either a Nurse or a Physician, with different permissions and uses of the application.  Users were differentiated through a login interface.  Unfortunately, due to a constraint on time, and having had to learn most of everything we used by ourselves, we could not manage data using a database, but instead used text files.

#Files
The latest version of the application files are located in Java_Files/Triage and text files had to be loaded onto individual devices in order for the application to operate as intended. In the README within the app folder, are the details and who I was working with.
