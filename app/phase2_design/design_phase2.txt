- The first entry in each line is the health card number, which will be used to identify which patient is which
- Each entry after that is seperated by a space
- For patient information, the format would look like "healthcardnumber name dob arrivaltimeanddate seenbydoctor" (Note that these are all variable names)
- For patient vitals, the format would look like "healthcardnumber listoftemperatures listofheartrates listofbloodpressures textdescription"
